# bat-distribution-connectivity

A pipeline to extract environmental data and train Random Forests to map bat
activity.

## Setup

### Environment

Those scripts are mostly relying on R libraries (and some Python), in order to
facilitate reproductibility, we recommend to install a (conda environment)[https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install] from
the env_bmre.txt file by pasting the following line in a terminal :

```bash
# cd bat-distribution-connectivity
conda install --name test_bmre --file env_bmre.txt
```
